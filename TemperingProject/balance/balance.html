                <p class="blurb">Balance is a really important aspect of life. I try to notice it as much as possible. For example, if I get more time to sleep I will be much more productive the next day. If I spend too mush time having fun adn enjoying the sun I will get a sunburn. Everything positive has negative consequences ad vice versa. Therefor, in order to be successful in life you must endure the failures and painful experiences as much as possible. This simulation displays balance by showing a stack of rectangles swaying from side ot side. As it gets closer to tipping over the screen will flash red showing the more hectic and painful aspects of life. As it gest closer to the center it mellows out and you feel a calmness from the upright rectangles. This repeats forever just as balance is an enate part of life.</p>
