            <p class="blurb">Insomnia has impacted my life for as long as I can remember. As a kid I would always have trouble falling asleep at night and waking up in the morning after beeing so tired from the lack of sleep. It is a horrible feeling; being wide awake even though you are completely exhausted. It can really take a toll on not just your energy but also your happiness. I made this simulation to show how counting sheep will never finish. The sheep will continue to fly across the screen forever just as insomnia can make an hour or two feel like an eternity.</p>
