            <p class="blurb">Stress is something that everybody has to deal with at some time or another. Managing that stress can be really hard for some people. I know thatI definetely find it hard to manage quite often. I made this simulation to help explain how stress can build up over time. Specifically this shows how with every new task or chore comes more tasks and chores. I demonstrate a task o hcore as a button on the screen. If you want to complete a task you must click it to erase it. However, this creates a few more buttons that you must remove. This keeps spiraling until you have a mess of buttons on your screen which emulates letting multiple tasks build up and not knowing where to begin to complete them.</p>
